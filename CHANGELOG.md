## [Unreleased]

### Added

- QUIC serving up to the handshake. A `transport = "quic"` listener binds,
  becomes ready instead of refusing, and carries a datagram through
  classification, address validation with Retry, admission, connection
  assembly, routing, and packet generation. The TLS handshake inside QUIC
  does not yet complete, so HTTP/3 requests are not served (#32).
- `composition.Controls`, a typed secret owner for every welded QUIC
  record. The pump, connection, assembly secret storage, and HTTP/3
  session control records are allocated through `mach-crypto`
  `SecretArray`, and a failed release retains wiped ownership for retry.
- `tools/check-version.sh`, which holds `mach.toml` and `src/hedge.mach`
  to the same release version.

### Changed

- Dependency graph moved to the released QUIC storage split: mach-std
  v0.34.0, mach-http v0.7.3, laurel v0.8.5, mach-tls v0.2.2, mach-quic
  v0.5.1, mach-acme v0.1.6, and mach-crypto pinned explicitly at v0.8.1.
- QUIC connection and pump backing is split between public storage and
  deep-secret storage. `ConnectionStorage` carries the public
  `assembly.Storage`; the deep-secret `assembly.SecretStorage` is owned
  per connection by `Controls`.
- The public `Runtime`, `Reloader`, `Pool`, and every public `*Storage`
  record retain no welded pointer. Code that needs the welded records
  borrows a stack-local `ControlView` that does not outlive the call.
- QUIC listener teardown follows the released lease contract: an
  unpublished listener uses `abort_initialize`, a normal close uses
  `finish_close_result`, and a retained cleanup is retried through
  `retry_cleanup` with the same handle.

### Fixed

- A QUIC connection ID whose sequence number is zero could never be
  published to the routing table, so every accepted connection was
  unreachable. RFC 9000 numbers a connection's first ID zero; the
  generations carry the validity signal, not the sequence.
- `advance` looped on a timer that was re-armed still due, starving the
  I/O completions the connection was waiting on. One pass now services a
  connection's timer once and yields.

### Removed

- The QUIC listener refusal path. A datagram listener no longer fails
  before readiness with a diagnostic.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Initial release. HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 over TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, with SNI,
  ALPN, and client certificates, qualified against curl, OpenSSL, and
  GnuTLS.
- Static files, reverse proxying, bounded caches, virtual host dispatch,
  and ACME over authenticated TLS against a compatible authority.
